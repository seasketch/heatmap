  """Generates Spatial Access Priority (SAP) raster map given run configuration

  Arguments:
    infile: path+filename of vector dataset containing features, format must be supported by fiona/gdal
    outpath: path to output heatmaps to.  Filename will be the same as the input, just with the .tif extension.  If not specified, heatmaps are output to the input folder
    overwrite: whether to overwrite existing heatmap output, defaults to false and skips
    method: method for calculating value: count, area, sap. Defaults to sap
    importanceField: name of vector attribute containing importance value used for SAP calculation
    importanceFactorField: name of vector attribute containing importanceFactor value for importance
    areaFactor: factor to change the area by dividing. For example if area of geometry is calculated in square meters, an areaFactor of 1,000,000 will make the SAP per square km. because 1 sq. km = 1000m x 1000m = 1mil sq. meters 
    uniqueIdField: field containing a unique Id for feature to use for logging the list of features included in the raster for verification.  Must not allow person to be re-identified
    outCrsString: the epsg code for the output raster coordinate system, defaults to epsg:3857 aka Web Mercator
    outResolution: length/width of planning unit in units of output coordinate system, defaults to 1000 (1000m = 1km)
    bounds: bounds to use for output raster, as [w, s, e, n] in CRS of infile.  Output raster will align to the top left, but will extend past the bottom right as needed to the next multiple of outResolution
    boundsPrecision: number of digits to round the coordinates of bound calculation to. useful if don't snap to numbers as expected
    allTouchedSmall: (boolean) use allTouched rasterize option for shapes with smaller shape index than a raster cell (area/perimeter length).  Ensures small and narrow shapes are not lost and every shape contributes heat to at least one pixel in result. Larger shapes are still picked up using Bresenham’s line algorithm because allTouched creates some seemingly invalid output (double counting) along shape boundaries. Using allTouched only for smallest shapes that need it mitigates this, but also uses additional memory, and will also carry more weight than shapes just above the index threshold.
    allTouchedSmallFactor: (number) use to increase the shapeIndex threshold for identifying small shapes.  shapeIndex threshold is calculated as (shapeIndex of a raster cell * allTouchedSmallFactor).  Defaults to 1.25.  Increasing the factor will identify increasingly larger shapes as "small" and to be run with AllTouched option.  Useful when you have polygons that are mostly large but have small areas that are long and narrow and thus spotty in being picked up
    fixGeom: if an invalid geometry is found, if fixGeom is True it attempts to fix using buffer(0), otherwise it fails.  Review the log to make sure the automated fix was acceptable
    logToFile: (boolean) whether to output logs, errors, and manifest to file or stdout

  Returns:
    Manifest of run
