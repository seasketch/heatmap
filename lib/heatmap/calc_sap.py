  """Core algorithm, calculates the spatial access priority (SAP) value for a single area

  Each respondent has a total SAP of 100, and each shape is assigned a portion
  of that 100. The SAP for a shape is calculated as (Importance / Area), which
  can be interpreted as "importance per area unit".  The area of the shape is
  calculated in the coordinate system used, for Web Mercator that yields
  square meters.  Use the areaFactor option to change this.
  
  Use the optional importanceFactor to accommodate additional variables, changing what the SAP represents.

  Parameters:
    geometry: Shapely geometry in 3857 (unit of meters)
    importance: importance of geometry (1-100)
    areaFactor: factor to change the area by dividing. For example if area of geometry is calculated in square meters, an areaFactor of 1,000,000 will make the SAP per square km. because 1 sq. km = 1000m x 1000m = 1mil sq. meters
    importanceFactor: numeric value to multiply the importance by.  Use to scale the SAP from being 'per respondent' to a larger group of livelihoods or even economic values 
    maxArea: limits the area of a shape in SAP calculation.  Gives shapes with high area an artifically lower one, increasing their SAP relative to others, increasing their presence in heatmap
    maxSap: limits the SAP value. Gives shapes with high priority an artificially lower one, decreasing their presence in heatmap
  Returns:
    SAP value for shape
