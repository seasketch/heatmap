![heatmap package](https://github.com/seasketch/python-sap-map/actions/workflows/test-heatmap.yml/badge.svg)

This package takes polygons and aggregates them into a heatmap using different methods

![example polygon](docs/img/survey-sap-start-end.png)

This aggregate map can be used in area-based planning exercises for identifying where important areas exist and measuring the impact if changes in access are made.
